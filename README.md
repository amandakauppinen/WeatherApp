## Weather App ##
#### Learning - Flutter BLoC ####

This is an old project specifically made to practice BLoC state management architecture using [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) in a mobile application.
It also makes use of [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) to retrieve raw weather data which is then parsed in-app to show to the user.
A valid key needs to be added to the apps constants file in order for it to work.

#### App Description ####

This app is a basic weather app. The user can select from a group of predefined cities and get both the current forecast as well as a 5-day forecast for the selected city. It includes icons that map to the weather type, as well as information on temperature, wind, etc.
